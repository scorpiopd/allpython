The admissions office at Calvin Coolidge’s Cool College has heard about your programming prowess and wants to get a piece of it for themselves. They’ve been inundated with applications and need a way to automate the filtering process. They collect three pieces of information for each applicant:

Their high school GPA, on a 0.0 - 4.0 scale.
Their personal statement, which is given a score on a 1 - 100 scale.
The number of extracurricular activities they participate in.
The admissions office has a cutoff point for each category. They want students that have a GPA of 3.0 or higher, a personal statement with a score of 90 or higher, and who participated in 3 or more extracurricular activities.

Write a function called applicant_selector which takes three inputs, gpa, ps_score, and ec_count. If the applicant meets the cutoff point for all three categories, have the function return the string:

"This applicant should be accepted."

Great! The admissions office also wants to give students who have a high GPA and a strong personal statement a chance even if they don’t participate in enough extracurricular activities.

If an applicant meets the cutoff point for GPA and personal statement score, but not the extracurricular activity count, the function should return the string:

"This applicant should be given an in-person interview."

Finally, for all other cases, the function should return the string:

"This applicant should be rejected."""


def applicant_selector(gpa, ps_score, ec_count):
  if gpa >= 3.0 and ps_score >= 90 and ec_count >= 3:
    return "This applicant should be accepted."
  elif gpa >= 3.0 and ps_score >= 90 and ec_count < 3:
    return "This applicant should be given an in-person interview."
  else:
    return "This applicant should be rejected."

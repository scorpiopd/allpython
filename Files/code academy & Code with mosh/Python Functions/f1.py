"""1.
Define a function called repeat_stuff that takes in two inputs, stuff, and num_repeats.

We will want to make this function print a string with stuff repeated num_repeats amount of times. For now, only put an empty print statement inside the function.

2.
Outside of the function, call repeat_stuff.

You can use the value "Row " for stuff and 3 for num_repeats.

3.
Change the print statement inside repeat_stuff to a return statement instead.

It should return stuff*num_repeats.

Note: Multiplying a string just makes a new string with the old one repeated! For example:

"na"*6
results in the string "nananananana".

4.
Give the parameter num_repeats a default value of 10.

5.
Add repeat_stuff("Row ", 3) and the string "Your Boat. " together and save the result to a variable called lyrics.

6.
Create a variable called song and assign it the value of repeat_stuff called with the singular input lyrics.


Stuck? Get a hint
7.
Print song.
